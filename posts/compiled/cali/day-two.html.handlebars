<h2 class="header thin black-text">Day Two - Sick Day</h2><p class="flow-text">I don&#39;t mean sick like good sick like the kids say. I literally stayed in bed in the hotel like the whole second day :( It&#39;s sort of like some cold symptoms mixes with a little vomiting, so overall pretty gross. So since this is going to be a boring post, I figured I&#39;d fill you in on the rest of Day One because after I got to my room I fought the initial urge to take a nap and was pulled in by the city....</p><p class="flow-text">After unpacking my things on the first day, I walked out of my room to the end of the hall where there was this cool fire escape:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Out the fire escape looking up 6th toward Market" src="http://i.imgur.com/VZRTiDB.jpg" data-caption="Out the fire escape looking up 6th toward Market" /></p><p class="flow-text">Too sunny to not be outside, and plus I really needed some like cold/sinus pills. I located the closest Walgreens with the intention of just going there and going back to the hotel to nap for awhile. but then I started seeing cool stuff and started walking. The first cool thing I saw was this old streetcar THAT&#39;S ACTUALLY A SUPER OLD VINTAGE TTC STREETCAR, COMPLETE WITH THE TTC LOGO ON THE BACK!!! WTF SO COOL!!</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Vintage TTC Streetcar in Downtown SF" src="http://i.imgur.com/mGuSie8.jpg" data-caption="Vintage TTC Streetcar in Downtown SF" /></p><p class="flow-text">They had other old ones from like Washington and other places, so I guess SF just collects old streetcars now? They were running and taking real passengers though. The actual old-school &quot;cable car tour&quot; thing that everyone does is something entirely different and is basically just for tourists to ride across a like 10 block stretch:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="It was like $20-something to ride 10 blocks, I&#39;ll walk thanks!" src="http://i.imgur.com/vBu9hap.jpg" data-caption="It was like $20-something to ride 10 blocks, I&#39;ll walk thanks!" /></p><p class="flow-text">Oh my god this city is so hilly! Like I expected hills but this is just nuts. It was like someone just decided &quot;hey you know what would be a great use of all this extremely hilly terrain...? A major US city!&quot;. And like climbing the hills is one thing, with me taking a water break every block, but I even found walking down them to be treacherous because of the steepness. Still, I wandered around the city for awhile coming across some pretty cool landmarks, such as Union Square (similar to Yonge &amp; Dundas square in TO; very commercial):</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Giant Christmas tree in union square, with palm trees not 10 feet from it lol" src="http://i.imgur.com/85jZc5C.jpg" data-caption="Giant Christmas tree in union square, with palm trees not 10 feet from it lol" /></p><p class="flow-text">I ended up doing a lot more walking than anticipated on Friday afternoon. I walked through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japantown,_San_Francisco" class="neato-link" target="_blank">Japantown</a>, took a selfie over a bridge (below) and then (I swear to god totally by accident) I stumbled into Alamo Square park, where I saw a bunch of people taking pictures. As I walked up the hill in the center of the park, I realized these people were taking selfies in front of San Francisco&#39;s most famous set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_ladies" class="neato-link" target="_blank">Painted Ladies</a>, the ones from the opening credits of Full House. I naturally took a million pictures, and because the park is situated on a hill, there is a nice view of the city in behind.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Selfie in Japantown" src="http://i.imgur.com/glHmyRn.jpg" data-caption="Selfie in Japantown" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Painted Ladies with Downtown SF in the backdrop" src="http://i.imgur.com/C7FiN9D.jpg" data-caption="Painted Ladies with Downtown SF in the backdrop" /></p><p class="flow-text">I continued walking, finding more and more beautiful examples of San Francisco architecture along the way. Look at some of these amazing homes!</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/22Hv45H.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/ErDHPv2.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/K1JPxTZ.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/7pzrO93.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text">As I walked through street after street of increasingly more beautiful homes, I wondered how San Franciscans kept these building so well painted (because all of the little details would be so well painted). Sure enough, I walked past a dude who was just finishing up a paint job on his house. I told him it looked beautiful and that it must take a lot of effort to maintain the paint on these places. I got the vibe that it&#39;s somewhat a point of pride for SF homeowners to keep their homes painted fresh with bold colors.</p><p class="flow-text">I finally found myself in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haight-Ashbury" class="neato-link" target="_blank">Haight-Ashbury</a> which was cool because there were a lot of old hippie shops that had been there since the 60s. Tons of little coffee shops and psychedelic clothing stores dotted the streets, but to be honest it didn&#39;t have that whole hipstery/gentrified feel to it. A lot of the folks I saw were old hippie types, always smiling, and a lot of the local business owners I spoke to said they had been in the Haight for more than 30 years. Right on the corner of Haight and Ashbury was a Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s, but I sadly wasn&#39;t in the mood for ice cream...</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s on the corner of Haight &amp; Ashbury" src="http://i.imgur.com/CyTBFgz.jpg" data-caption="Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s on the corner of Haight &amp; Ashbury" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="I don&#39;t know why but I found this so funny" src="http://i.imgur.com/XjuYTE0.jpg" data-caption="I don&#39;t know why but I found this so funny" /></p><p class="flow-text">The sun started setting so I started back on my way. Initially I was planning on taking transit/Uber back to the hotel but I ended up just walking the whole way back. I got back to the hotel around 6pm, the sun had just gone down, and seeing as this was 9pm EST, mixed with the fact that I was exhausted from traveling, I passed right out.</p><h4 class="header thin black-text">Day Two (for reals)</h4><p class="flow-text">Okay so my actual Day Two (Saturday) was not awesome. I felt awful as soon as I woke up and vomited a little. I intended on seeing the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz today. I thought &quot;okay lets not push it, we&#39;ll just take the day slow&quot;. So I got dressed and began walking over to <a href="http://www.mrholmesbakehouse.com/" class="neato-link" target="_blank">Mr. Holmes Bakehouse</a> for one of their illusive Cruffins (it&#39;s a muffin and a croissant in one - buddy from work told me it was a must-have when visiting SF). By the time I got within a few blocks, my symptoms had worsened a little and I decided to write off the day so that I could just sleep and feel better for the rest of the trip. Kinda shitty, but if I pushed myself I know it would have made things worse.</p><p class="flow-text">Still though, on my way back to the hotel I managed to see something cool! Here&#39;s what San Francisco city hall looks like, pretty majestic:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="like a bunch of people were meditating out front of it, pretty chill..." src="http://i.imgur.com/rzNbIGB.jpg" data-caption="like a bunch of people were meditating out front of it, pretty chill..." /></p>
