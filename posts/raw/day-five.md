## Day Five

Day five is a weird and boring day for the blog, because most of the day was spent waiting around for my flight to Los Angeles. I should have planned better as my checkout time at the hotel was 11am and my flight wasn't until 5:46pm :|  ...certainly not ideal.

I woke up and felt hungry so I Googled "breakfast" and learned there was a 24hr Denny's right around the corner. Perfect! Did you know Denny's makes oatmeal? It tastes like shit, never order it. But the hashbrowns and fruit was yummy!

After that, I went for one last stroll through the neighbourhood before heading back to the hotel. I packed up the last of my things, said goodbye to the sweet old couple who run the hotel, and was on my way.

So here's why today sucks: I have Dan's big hiking pack which is like my main luggage bag on my back, and then I have my carry-on bag which is my usual smaller Vans backpack. Thats two backpacks. So I looked like a dope with the big one on my back and then one on my front. I walked past where all the big tech companies are located in downtown SF:

I eventually ended up at a coffeeshop where I hijacked their wifi for 2 hours in exchange for buying a single cup of coffee. Mostly just killing time. At around 2pm I decided to get to the airport so I could ditch the larger bag. I hit up the nearest BART stop and got right down there.

I was so early for check in they didn't even have a gate yet. No worries, I went through security anyway (I'm getting good at this now) and found something to eat. After eating I still had around 2 hours 'till my flight so I found an airport bar and ordered a drink.

Finally the flight was boarding and I got on. I got a window seat and, as luck would have it, the two seats next to me were empty ;) When the flight attendants came around I grabbed a can of coke and the flight was so quick that I didn't even have time to finish it.

#### Coming Into Los Angeles

Holy shit Los Angeles is massive. As we flew in, the sheer size just baffled me. I immediately realized I would not be able to do as much walking as I did in SF.

I got off the plane and found my bag. As soon as I stepped outside I could tell the weather was much nicer here than in SF. I then hopped on a FlyAway bus which is like a large coach bus similar to a GO bus. This takes me from LAX to Union Station in downtown LA for only $8. I called Katie, the AirBnB host to tell her I was close. From there it was a quick Uber ride over to her place on South Mariposa Ave, near Koreatown. The Uber driver Richard was telling me how he's a high school teacher by day and drives Uber at night to help pay the bills. Having lived in LA his whole life, he had some good recommendations about where to eat around where I was staying. He also told me about a nearby "brewcade" (brewery and arcade) that I will have to check out.

#### AirBnB is the best

Katie was waiting out front to greet me as soon as Richard dropped me off. She has "superhost" status on AirBnB, meaning that she's hosted heaps of people who have all given her 5-star ratings, and I quickly saw why. She is so sweet and inviting! Her house is so nice too, it's the upstairs of this (huge) old 1920's house. She has basically three bedrooms, and she rents out two of them on AirBnB.

There's better pictures and info available [on the actual AirBnB site for the room](https://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/6337144). She's super into cooking and stuff and just has treats in the dining room that she welcomes me to take. They are SO good:

By this time it was like 9:30-10pm or so and I was exhausted from all that traveling, so I watched something on my laptop as I fell asleep. Who knows what tomorrow has in store!
