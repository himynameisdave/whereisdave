## Day Four

Day four is the busiest day yet, so I'm going to try to keep things concise. Regardless, get ready for awesome!

#### Cruffin

After my failed attempt at obtaining the illusive Cruffin (the half croissant, half muffin) on Saturday, I returned to [Mr. Holmes Bakehouse](http://www.mrholmesbakehouse.com/) shortly after they opened this morning...

The Cruffin flavor of the day was matcha (like green tea) which sounds disgusting but it was honestly delicious:

#### Chinatown

After devouring my Cruffin along with a coffee, I began meandering around for awhile. I walked up Grant Avenue, where I saw the Dragon's Gate from the night before, which marks the entrance to [San Francisco's Chinatown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_San_Francisco). It's a really cool area, and I think because it was a Monday morning, it wasn't too crowded or busy like it can get on Spadina in Toronto sometimes.

At this time of the day (maybe like 10:30am) it was hella foggy. Here's the invisible Transamerica Pyramid from only a short distance away...

#### Alcatraz

So seeing as I was sick on Saturday, when I intended to do Alcatraz, I figured today was the day to do it. After making it through Chinatown I headed down to the piers where the boats were.

The boat was actually very large and even had a snack bar on it. And because 'merica you could even order an alcoholic drink, you know, for that crazy 12 minute ride to the island. Oh but only on the way back though, wouldn't want anyone to be drunk on the island lol...

The whole tour was very well run. Like pretty much you get off the boat and they give you a few guidelines/do's and dont's and then they basically let you run free (unlike the convicts who formerly lived there). And then when you get up to the cell house there is like an audio tour which I thought would be so stupid but was actually amazing. It was narrated by one of the old guards which gave it that all the more eery tone.

Overall it was super cool, and also terrifyingly creepy. It was also interesting to hear about how it inevitably failed as a prison due to the fact that it cost so much to keep the prisoners there. Best of all was seeing how the [1962 escape from the island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_1962_Alcatraz_escape) was carried out.

#### Fisherman's Wharf II

I returned from the island to find myself close to Fisherman's Wharf, which I had visited yesterday but not extensively. I kid you not I was so close to buying a shark's jaws to hang on my wall at home, and my only hesitation was "how the hell am I going to explain that to the TSA agent at the airport". I opted instead for a single shark tooth.

As cool as all of this stuff was, it wasn't nearly as amazing as what I saw next...

#### The Golden Gate Bridge

Google told me that it would take me like an hour to walk from the Wharf to the Golden Gate Bridge, so I instead opted for my first San Francisco transit ride. I waited at the stop for awhile and a nice local dude told me what bus to get on and stuff. He was saying how he lives like north in like wine country because rent in the city is insane, and how his commute everyday is 2.5+ hours one way. Jeeeeeze.

Now by this point it was sunny out and the fog had completely dissipated. I got off the bus and immediately saw the one thing I wanted to see in San Francisco the most...

![Hello gorgeous!](http://i.imgur.com/qehvU3n.jpg)

I then proceeded to walk across that sucker. Boy is it ever long. By the time I got past the second tower I really had to pee, plus my phone was dying and I was worried I wouldn't be able to navigate back/hail an Uber without it so I turned back to where I knew for sure there were restrooms.

Fun fact: you are only allowed to walk on the east side of the bridge (facing the inside of the bay). The other side is open to cyclists though. My original plan was to walk along the east side one way and then the west side the other way, but no dice. Also after 6:30pm pedestrians aren't allowed on the bridge.

![It was the perfect time of day to see it too...](http://i.imgur.com/8WxsPEi.jpg)

All in all it was a fantastic day. So now I have to pack all my shit (I packed way too much shit) because checkout it at 11am tomorrow. Then I am going to do some last minute sightseeing/souvenir-buying in SF before my flight to LA at around 5pm. My time in San Francisco went by so fast :( dang being sick!
