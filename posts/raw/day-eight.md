## Day Eight

I have been sleeping amazing at Katie's place, due in part to having the windows open and letting all that beautiful California night air in. It sucks that I'll have to leave this place tomorrow. My flight isn't until late at night (10pm or something), and although checkout time is noon, Katie said it's cool that I leave my bags here cause she's cool as fuck. So I basically get an extra full day in LA thanks to her generosity. I think I'm going to get her a thank you card or something for being so accommodating these last few days.

I didn't sleep in that much today, and it's 8am right now. Determined to not get McDicks for a third time, I Googled around for some sit down breakfast places that aren't Denny's. There are some but they don't have french toast and I am feeling french toast. There is an IHOP though (and they [absolutely have french toast](http://www.ihop.com/menus/main-menu/whats-new/banana-bread-french-toast)) and we don't have those back home so I think I'll give that a shot.

After breakfast I headed back to the house to prep for the hike up at Griffith Park. After leaving I stopped at a grocery store for water and provisions. I hopped on a bus that went straight up Normandie to Hollywood Blvd. where I got off to begin my hike up to Griffith Observatory.

#### Griffith Observatory

I started into the park. The hills were mild and manageable at this point, and I was impressed with how well maintained they were with garbage bins every stage of the way. Good job LA!

There was a 40% chance of a shower, and because I was there of course it had to actually happen. It was just a mild shower though and was actually pretty refreshing so I just made the best of it. I got further up the trail and I could see the observatory better and better. The views of LA and the Hollywoo sign were fantastic even from down here.

Hiking in these parts is a little bit different than the simple Ontario hikes I am used to, due in part to all the deadly nature (more on this later) mixed with the fact that everything in LA is massive, including the hills.

By this point the rain had moved on to downtown LA, which I was now high enough in the hills to actually see. It was now sunny and nice on the trails.

The observatory was pretty neat. You can go inside for free but to actually see a show at the planetarium costs money. Thankfully there was a small cafe where I acquired more provisions for the rest of my hike. There was also a school group there so I didn't stay long, nor did I want to as I had more hiking to do.

#### Mount Hollywood

After leaving the observatory, I began to scale Mt. Hollywood. Despite popular belief, the Hollywoo sign is in fact on Mount Lee, which is right beside Mount Hollywood. Mt. Hollywood goes up quite a bit higher than Griffith Observatory and it's where I got some of my best views of LA and the Hollywoo sign.

I got all the way to the top which was super cool. I hung out there for a while despite the extreme winds (no actually, there was like a wind advisory for LA today) and munched on some goldfish and drank from my massive water bottle. I was sooo close to the Hollywoo sign now.

I could even see to the other side of Los Angeles now, into Burbank and North Hollywood.

#### Hollywoo Sign...

As I was getting closer to the Hollywoo Sign, the trails began splitting and got harder and harder to follow. I made a series of wrong turns but, unphased, I kept along, despite the large amount of horse poop. The trails had been very quiet for the last hour or so and I was starting to see less and less hikers or cyclists.

![There was a lot of this shit](http://i.imgur.com/NhcBO6C.jpg)

After making another wrong turn and beginning to backtrack a little, I saw what I first thought was someone's dog. And then I saw another slightly smaller one. And then another. And then another. I quickly realized that these were not dogs but coyotes. They quickly darted off down the path where I was hoping to go down. I was mixed with fear and wonder; they were so cool and majestic.

I then saw a cyclist, as at this point there were basically no hikers anymore, and he said he had seen them too and that they were following him, which he found unnerving. Clearly a local, he basically was like "yeah what are you doing hiking up here by yourself, you're dumb kid" and then said "enjoy your walk" before leaving me all alone again. Given that it was around 4pm and the sun was starting to set fast, I was fucking terrified.

Convinced that this was how I would die, alone in one of the most beautiful places I'd ever seen, I then darted off down the path that I thought led to Mt. Lee. I was sooo incorrect, as it only led down the other side of Mt. Lee, and by the time I figured that out it was too late for me to turn back (not to mention the deadly, vicious, rabid, deadly terrible coyotes were back that way). The path did happen to lead past [Haunted Picnic Table #29](http://bit.ly/1RJDd73) where a young couple was killed by a falling tree [in 1976](http://www.latirnes.com/news/local/la-me-haunted30oct30/). This only served to fuel my fear so I picked up the pace. I took no pictures around here because I was trying to [GTFO](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=GTFO) as fast as possible.

I ended up [all the way at the back of Griffith Park](http://bit.ly/1NLTrec). Like the extreme end. And the shittiest part is that I didn't even get to go up behind the Hollywoo Sign on Mt. Lee like I intended. Feeling defeated, but happy to be alive and not contaminated with coyote rabies, I UberXcaped from that whole situation back to the house.

My Uber driver Bryan arrived in a Benz, which was pretty balling and also hilarious because I smelled like terror and horse shit. He was extremely talkative and is actually an actor, among other things. He's been in big-budget national commercials and some smaller TV shows. He does Uber to help pay the bills when auditions don't go well, but he said his last gig (an Avicci music video) payed well over $60k though. I loved how forthcoming he was about being an actor and like the ins and outs of the industry, and how basically to make it you have to join the [SAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild) and to join you need to get vouched for three times plus pay them $30k. Showbiz, am I right?

I got back to the house and then went out to a nearby place for a quick burrito. It's so cold here because of the wind. I later Googled all about coyotes in Griffith Park and, despite a few isolated incidents, there was really nothing to be afraid of as they're pretty docile. I don't know why that cyclist was so uptight, maybe one attacked his dog one time or something. After learning this I am now kicking myself for not going back and tackling Mt. Lee because I really wanted to do that.

I now have to pack up my things (sad) so that I can vacate the room by noon tomorrow. I can still leave my bags though so I am thinking about something to do before my 10pm flight tomorrow night... Last day in California! :(
