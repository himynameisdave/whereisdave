## Day Seven

Today I slept in a bit because hey, I'm on vacation so why not right? The goal today was to do Venice Beach & Santa Monica Pier. These are not nearly as close as Hollywood was yesterday, so the plan is to take Uber there. I got myself dressed and then went (again) to McDicks for breakfast (it's all day breakfast now, eh) but this time I opted for the pancakes because, again, I haven't had them in years.

After finishing breakfast around 11am, I opened up Uber on my phone. Because of the distance to the beach, I chose the UberPool option. UberPool is their service where you input where you're going, and then Uber uses an algorithm to find other riders going in the same general direction as you so that you can pick them up and split the cost of the ride. It turned what would have been a $25-30 ride into a $15 ride, plus I had some cool chats with locals about living in Los Angeles and stuff. Uber is the bomb.

#### Venice Beach

The UberPool took about 45mins (we picked up two other people). As soon as I stepped out of the car I was around the Venice Beach Pier.

Not satisfied with simply looking at the ocean, I took off my shoes, rolled up my pants and went in up to my ankles.

#### Venice Canals

So [TIL](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TIL&defid=4190243) that Venice is in fact named after the Venice in Italy. The dude who originally developed part of the land attempted to re-create the Italian city by creating a series of canals. Then automobiles became a thing and the canals became dumb, so they filled them in. Except for [a small little section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Canal_Historic_District) of them which still exist. I was in the 'hood so I figured I'd check them out.

The houses surrounding this area are obviously fantastic (and no doubt way out of my price range). I'm sure the nosey tourists drive down the price though.

#### Venice Boardwalk

I then began walking up the Venice Boardwalk. Everyone here is on a longboard, it's making me jealous.

I eventually got to the main part, where there are tons of little shops selling everything, including t-shirts, knicknacks, hot dogs, ice cream, bongs, and even medical weed. Yep, I kid you not. California has super lax weed laws, and to get your medicinal license there is a snap. You tell a doctor that you're stressed or can't sleep, give him $40 and boom you're allowed to buy legal medical weed. Sadly this doesn't apply to out of state residents :(

![Right on the beach. There are 100's of these clinics in LA](http://i.imgur.com/4sgiv9b.jpg)

A bunch of people were crowding around these street performers who were just about to start a show. They were a bunch of young guys who were really good at breakdancing and acrobatics and stuff, and there was this one guy who was like MC'ing who was hilarious. It was crazy they got volunteers from the audience and then did like flips over them. It was so rad.

I transitioned from the boardwalk to the beach and back a number of times so I could really take it all in. I walked past Muscle Beach which is literally just a bunch of old gym equipment that looks like it's from back in Schwarzenegger's heyday. It was a little chilly with the wind (plus it was kind of cloudy) so the beach was super empty. No one was in the water, save for a few surfers back around the Venice Pier.

I still wanted to get all the way up to Santa Monica, which actually isn't all that far of a walk, so I kept along the boardwalk.

#### Santa Monica Pier

By this point I had eaten some fries on the boardwalk and it was around 3/3:30pm. Sunset was in about an hour and a bit so my timing here couldn't have been better. It was absolutely beautiful, in the same way seeing the Golden Gate Bridge on Monday was beautiful. It gave me the biggest smile =D

I eventually saw the ferris wheel and I knew I had made it. It took no time at all.

By now it was ice cream time, because let's be real when is it not a good time for ice cream, right? I know it was almost dinner time but whatever I'm on vacation DON'T JUDGE, ice cream is the bomb! I walked around the pier for awhile and took in all the sights. I didn't go on the rides though, as it was super chilly due to the high winds.

![I ate it by the roller coaster, watching the sun go down](http://i.imgur.com/mYUWagm.jpg)

![I love the mountains in the backdrop](http://i.imgur.com/qMFPECC.jpg)

This didn't turn out so great for Tom Hanks, so I decided against it...

By this point I was freezing, as the sun had gone down but the wind was fierce on the beach. I realized I had to get away from the beach so I walked up Santa Monica Blvd. As I kept walking, I randomly found myself in one of LA's open-air malls. So weird, I didn't even realize that I was walking into it.

As it turns out, [Santa Monica Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica_Place) was originally designed by Frank Gehry (Canadian-born architect, did the somewhat-recent AGO redesign, and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown LA) however it has since been modified completely. Fun history facts!

I ate at this upscale restaurant called [True Food](http://www.yelp.com/biz/true-food-kitchen-santa-monica) for dinner. Although not strictly vegetarian, they are very serious about fresh food and supporting local farmers and all that, so the meat they do have is all free-range and organic/antibiotic free. I ordered a craft IPA from a local brewer called "Down To Earth" which was the best beer I've had on the trip so far. I ordered the Quinoa burger which came with sweet potato hashbrowns, and the whole meal was absolutely phenomenal. I have eaten fairly shitty so far this trip (2 McDicks stops in 2 days is bad news bears) so it was amazing to have something so fresh and yummy. The staff were super friendly as well.

![It was located right in Santa Monica Place](http://i.imgur.com/sqhbRZf.jpg)

As I was finishing up my meal, the cute bartender recommended I walk over to the nearby [Third Street Promenade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Street_Promenade) next, as I mentioned I was looking for something to do before making the trek back to the house.

#### Third Street Promenade

So the Third Street Promenade essentially adjacent to Santa Monica Place, and similarly it's sort of an open-air shopping center, complete with a giant ass Apple store. I farted around there a little bit and stopped in at a few of the shops. I bought a cool shirt, sipped a post-dinner coffee, and enjoyed the Christmas decorations on palm trees.

![It was very quiet, because of the cold probably.](http://i.imgur.com/qObrFXX.jpg)

By now it was around 7:30pm and I was getting tired. Rather than take an Uber back, I wanted to test the LA transit system. Google told me it was only a single bus, straight across Wilshire Blvd. so I had nothing to lose. The fare was only $1.75 which is a LOT cheaper than any Uber ride so this worked for me. I got off at Wilshire & Normandie, about a 10 min walk from the house, and stopped into a convenience store for snacks for while I write this post before heading to bed.

Tomorrow is Griffith Park!
