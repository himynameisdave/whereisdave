## Day Six


I woke up feeling well rested this morning, and with a beautiful breeze coming through the open windows. Katie has a little coffee machine that's all ready to go so all I had to do was turn it on :) I drank some coffee and had one of her delicious banana pecan muffins while I wrote day five's post and planned out my day. Today, Dave does [Hollywoo](http://i.imgur.com/pY4XNYn.jpg)!

#### Hollywoo

I know I've said this before but I'll say it again, LA IS HUGE. I left the house around 9:30 in the morning, and was still feeling a little peckish so I stopped in at a nearby McDonalds for some hash browns (because I haven't had their hash browns in like forever). I then proceeded to walk [all the way to Hollywoo Blvd.](https://goo.gl/maps/vhHnEwDhBiq), which is by no means close because it's LA and nothing is close.

The weather is very very nice here, sunshine and it was warm enough to be in a t-shirt. I could have even got away with shorts. I started up a hill and caught my first (very distant) glimpse of the Hollywoo sign. Can you see it?

I eventually made it down to the Hollywoo walk of fame, which is very expansive because they put everyone who has ever been in a film or TV show in the past 1000 years on it. I literally saw a star for Tinkerbell.

Here's the Capitol Records building (much smaller than I imagined):

At this point after all the walking I was hungry, so I stopped into this place called Melt on Sunset which does like really quality grilled cheese sammies:

By this point it was easier to see the Hollywoo sign:

I walked further down Hollywoo Blvd. and saw Kimmel's studios.

It was not far from here that I noticed a camera crew speeding down the street interviewing people. As luck would have it they asked me to finish the following sentence: "Donald Trump is the worst thing to happen to..." and the response they were looking for was "ISIS" (which is a statement Trump had made earlier in the week). The joke was that everyone had something else to finish the sentence with, and my response was "America". I signed a release and they actually used my bit! You can see me [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zmlQbt2UIA) for half a second shortly after the 1:04 mark. Only in LA!

After this I meandered around for a little bit more. I saw some cool stuff:

It was starting to get later in the afternoon and I was tired from all the walking so I wanted to head back and take a nap before dinnertime. I walked about halfway back and then Uber'd the rest of the way. Look at how beautiful it is from my window:

#### Jurassic Pizza

I took a short power nap, and then set out to feed myself dinner. Google found me a really cool pizza pub on Wilshire not far from where I was staying. I headed there and it was so cool! They had an awesome selection of craft beers and they were playing the original Jurassic Park movie. I sat and watched the entire thing while I ate a delicious handmade pizza, which was fun because me and the other patrons provided some fun commentary for the movie and laughed at the goofy parts [(like Goldblum's laugh)](https://youtu.be/JlOx9738iyw?t=15s). After this I walked around the neighbourhood for a little, found a Baskin Robbins and got myself some ice cream before retiring to the house for the night. I Netflixed for a little but fell asleep very soon after - I was so tired.
