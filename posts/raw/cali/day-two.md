## Day Two - Sick Day

I don't mean sick like good sick like the kids say. I literally stayed in bed in the hotel like the whole second day :( It's sort of like some cold symptoms mixes with a little vomiting, so overall pretty gross. So since this is going to be a boring post, I figured I'd fill you in on the rest of Day One because after I got to my room I fought the initial urge to take a nap and was pulled in by the city....

After unpacking my things on the first day, I walked out of my room to the end of the hall where there was this cool fire escape:

Too sunny to not be outside, and plus I really needed some like cold/sinus pills. I located the closest Walgreens with the intention of just going there and going back to the hotel to nap for awhile. but then I started seeing cool stuff and started walking. The first cool thing I saw was this old streetcar THAT'S ACTUALLY A SUPER OLD VINTAGE TTC STREETCAR, COMPLETE WITH THE TTC LOGO ON THE BACK!!! WTF SO COOL!!

They had other old ones from like Washington and other places, so I guess SF just collects old streetcars now? They were running and taking real passengers though. The actual old-school "cable car tour" thing that everyone does is something entirely different and is basically just for tourists to ride across a like 10 block stretch:

Oh my god this city is so hilly! Like I expected hills but this is just nuts. It was like someone just decided "hey you know what would be a great use of all this extremely hilly terrain...? A major US city!". And like climbing the hills is one thing, with me taking a water break every block, but I even found walking down them to be treacherous because of the steepness. Still, I wandered around the city for awhile coming across some pretty cool landmarks, such as Union Square (similar to Yonge & Dundas square in TO; very commercial):

I ended up doing a lot more walking than anticipated on Friday afternoon. I walked through [Japantown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japantown,_San_Francisco), took a selfie over a bridge (below) and then (I swear to god totally by accident) I stumbled into Alamo Square park, where I saw a bunch of people taking pictures. As I walked up the hill in the center of the park, I realized these people were taking selfies in front of San Francisco's most famous set of [Painted Ladies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_ladies), the ones from the opening credits of Full House. I naturally took a million pictures, and because the park is situated on a hill, there is a nice view of the city in behind.

I continued walking, finding more and more beautiful examples of San Francisco architecture along the way. Look at some of these amazing homes!

As I walked through street after street of increasingly more beautiful homes, I wondered how San Franciscans kept these building so well painted (because all of the little details would be so well painted). Sure enough, I walked past a dude who was just finishing up a paint job on his house. I told him it looked beautiful and that it must take a lot of effort to maintain the paint on these places. I got the vibe that it's somewhat a point of pride for SF homeowners to keep their homes painted fresh with bold colors.

I finally found myself in [Haight-Ashbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haight-Ashbury) which was cool because there were a lot of old hippie shops that had been there since the 60s. Tons of little coffee shops and psychedelic clothing stores dotted the streets, but to be honest it didn't have that whole hipstery/gentrified feel to it. A lot of the folks I saw were old hippie types, always smiling, and a lot of the local business owners I spoke to said they had been in the Haight for more than 30 years. Right on the corner of Haight and Ashbury was a Ben & Jerry's, but I sadly wasn't in the mood for ice cream...

The sun started setting so I started back on my way. Initially I was planning on taking transit/Uber back to the hotel but I ended up just walking the whole way back. I got back to the hotel around 6pm, the sun had just gone down, and seeing as this was 9pm EST, mixed with the fact that I was exhausted from traveling, I passed right out.

#### Day Two (for reals)

Okay so my actual Day Two (Saturday) was not awesome. I felt awful as soon as I woke up and vomited a little. I intended on seeing the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz today. I thought "okay lets not push it, we'll just take the day slow". So I got dressed and began walking over to [Mr. Holmes Bakehouse](http://www.mrholmesbakehouse.com/) for one of their illusive Cruffins (it's a muffin and a croissant in one - buddy from work told me it was a must-have when visiting SF). By the time I got within a few blocks, my symptoms had worsened a little and I decided to write off the day so that I could just sleep and feel better for the rest of the trip. Kinda shitty, but if I pushed myself I know it would have made things worse.

Still though, on my way back to the hotel I managed to see something cool! Here's what San Francisco city hall looks like, pretty majestic:
