<h2 class="header thin black-text">Day Three</h2><p class="flow-text">Day three was off to a much better start than day two. Last night I managed to get quite a lot of sleep and drank quite a lot of Gatorade. The electrolytes were helpful cause I wasn&#39;t really able to stomach much food yesterday aside from like an apple and a banana.</p><p class="flow-text">So the day started off with a long Skype call with Dan which was nice. I told him about how terrifying America can be but also how amazing and cool it can be at the same time. It&#39;s sort of like &quot;hey look at all this nice stuff but also that guy is probably carrying a gun so watch out!&quot; Weird place, definitely a bit of a culture shock, but like I said there is something common about all major cities and so in an odd way it kind of feels like Toronto still.</p><p class="flow-text">After I got off Skype with Dan it was around 10am PST (1pm EST) and even though I wasn&#39;t feeling 100% I was ready to go do some exploring. I showered in the hotel&#39;s shower on my floor - nothing fancy but it did the trick. After that I got myself ready and just as I was about to leave some girl from the hotel came in to change the towels and sheets which was nice considering I had sweat buckets into them the previous night.</p><h4 class="header thin black-text">America still uses pennies, lol</h4><p class="flow-text">I got some change back the other day and laughed because they still have the penny down here, despite the fact that it costs them 1.7 cents to make each one. They need to get rid of it though, and there is no way I&#39;m bringing a mit full of these things back up to Canada.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="2015 and these goofs are still minting pennies..." src="http://i.imgur.com/CITllJk.jpg" data-caption="2015 and these goofs are still minting pennies..." /></p><p class="flow-text">I very briefly farted around the mall for a little bit, mostly because Dan wanted me to check out the new Microsoft phones that haven&#39;t been released in Canada yet. I didn&#39;t think they were that great but regardless I can now give him my official review/brag that I saw a phone first for once.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Nothing special" src="http://i.imgur.com/MYG9hvg.jpg" data-caption="Nothing special" /></p><h4 class="header thin black-text">City Lights</h4><p class="flow-text">The next place I walked to was the famed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Lights_Bookstore" class="neato-link" target="_blank">City Lights Bookstore</a>, which has published and sold a lot of Beat-generation and counter-culture books since the 1950&#39;s. The people here were so nice and inviting! I don&#39;t even like books that much but I kid you not they had so many books I had to pick up and read the back of! Very different vibe than a Chapters or Indigo.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/mhfQjJJ.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/15g4taw.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text">As you can tell, the rain started by this point but it was kind of a nice gentle rain like we sometimes get in Toronto in the spring. The weather in this city is weird though, one minute I&#39;m hot the next minute I&#39;m freezing. Could be that I&#39;m just getting over that whole sickness thing too. Regardless, next stop is Telegraph Hill!</p><h4 class="header thin black-text">Coit Tower</h4><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Coit Tower, atop Telegraph Hill" src="http://i.imgur.com/pZA6AO6.jpg" data-caption="Coit Tower, atop Telegraph Hill" /></p><p class="flow-text">So perched atop this intense, steep, Everest-like hill is this cool old art deco tower built in 1933 called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coit_Tower" class="neato-link" target="_blank">Coit Tower</a>. The tower itself isn&#39;t that tall, but given the fact that it&#39;s situated on top of one of SF&#39;s tallest hills means that even from the base you get an amazing view of not only the city but the entire bay area.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="By this point I was very out of breath" src="http://i.imgur.com/B51E5Nm.jpg" data-caption="By this point I was very out of breath" /></p><p class="flow-text">I walked around the grounds/base of the tower for a bit to admire all of the huge murals depicting San Francisco/Bay area history. It was cool and they even had guides there to explain like what they were and stuff. But I didn&#39;t climb this damn hill to look at art! I paid the 8 bucks to ride the rickety old elevator to the top. Now obviously the views are better when it isn&#39;t raining, but I was still absolutely taken aback when I got to the top:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="The very prominent Transamerica Pyramid is visible, along with the financial district and Bay Bridge" src="http://i.imgur.com/0XxQTaU.jpg" data-caption="The very prominent Transamerica Pyramid is visible, along with the financial district and Bay Bridge" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="You know, it doesn&#39;t look too hilly from up here..." src="http://i.imgur.com/9d5ffzf.jpg" data-caption="You know, it doesn&#39;t look too hilly from up here..." /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Barely visible is Alcatraz" src="http://i.imgur.com/F6XYIj0.jpg" data-caption="Barely visible is Alcatraz" /></p><p class="flow-text">The guy said on a clear day you can make out most of the Golden Gate bridge. I could&#39;t see it at all but I could see the Bay Bridge fairly well which was still pretty neat. I spent a while up there because it was so cool.</p><h4 class="header thin black-text">Lombard Street</h4><p class="flow-text">The next place I wanted to visit was the crooked section of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_(San_Francisco" class="neato-link" target="_blank">Lombard Street</a>. At first I thought San Francisco was just doing this to be weird but it&#39;s actually because this block was too steep for cars to go down safely, so they had to like break it up a bit. LIKE HOW ABOUT IF NATURE TELLS YOU YOU CAN&#39;T HAVE A ROAD THERE, YOU SIMPLY CAN&#39;T HAVE A ROAD THERE! Nope, not in San Francisco, where crafting streetscapes on top of vicious hills is their favorite pastime:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/z40WYOZ.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="The people that live on this block must absolutely hate the tourists." src="http://i.imgur.com/2FOBdfU.jpg" data-caption="The people that live on this block must absolutely hate the tourists." /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Yeah no shit tour buses are prohibited" src="http://i.imgur.com/N7pOBcY.jpg" data-caption="Yeah no shit tour buses are prohibited" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/Ee83Gpe.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text">After this, the rain had picked up and become slightly less pleasant. I still wanted to check out Fisherman&#39;s Wharf and I was fairly close by so I headed down. I found this aptly-titled street name:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/WVB0FR9.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text">Now, when I was walking around the city on the first day, I thought that hooligans had just carved the name of the street into the wet pavement, but actually it&#39;s a thing in SF on all the streets. It actually makes it easier sometimes when the street signs are farther away and thus harder to read.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="This city looooves their streetcars/trams/cable cars" src="http://i.imgur.com/eIuUuLf.jpg" data-caption="This city looooves their streetcars/trams/cable cars" /></p><p class="flow-text">I didn&#39;t see a whole lot of Fisherman&#39;s Wharf, mostly because it was getting later and I was getting hungry. Plus I was wet and wanted to go dry up at the hotel before dinner. Seeing as I was about a <a href="http://bit.ly/1m6cmWJ" class="neato-link" target="_blank">45 min</a> walk from the hotel, and it was still raining, I opted for a warm, dry Uber ride instead.</p><p class="flow-text">Seeing as San Francisco is the mecca of all things tech, they have already been so progressive in regulating Uber here (cough cough, hint hint Toronto). For instance, all Uber and Lyft drivers must have a sticker on the windshield identifying them as a driver as opposed to just some random car. Even though you already know the drivers name, face, their car make, model, car color, and licence plate number before you even get near their car, I still found this to be such a smart idea. Let&#39;s get on this, Uber Toronto!</p><p class="flow-text">I got into the car and had a great chat with my driver Armando. We chatted about shitty customers he&#39;s had but also about how the taxi industry here has started to adapt to having Uber in the marketplace, instead of <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2015/12/04/john-tory-says-uber-injunction-not-on-the-table.html" class="neato-link" target="_blank">all the whining and crying thats going on back home right now</a> over this exact same issue. These debates seem hilarious and trivial to me because in 10 years all the drivers are going to be unemployed thanks to the rise of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/17/uber-well-ease-the-transition-to-self-driving-cars" class="neato-link" target="_blank">self-driving cars</a>.</p><h4 class="header thin black-text">A Super Duper Milkshake</h4><p class="flow-text">What to do to feed my now starving stomach. I Googled around for some suggestions but all the results offered me were shitty American fast-food joints like Burger King and In-and-Out Burger. They did get me thinking burgers though, and then after another, more refined Googling, I found a place I remember walking past called Super Duper Burger. They&#39;re a very small chain with only a few locations in the Bay area, and sort of have that whole 50&#39;s diner feel but like with emphasis on organic and fresh ingredients so it&#39;s sort of more of a modern take on it.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Super Duper!" src="http://i.imgur.com/4pg52FX.jpg" data-caption="Super Duper!" /></p><p class="flow-text">I ordered a delicious veggie burger, fries, and an amazing milkshake. Not kidding, it had me all like:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="https://vibescinemaclub.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/tumblr_inline_mhhuipg66h1qz4rgp.gif" /></p><p class="flow-text">After that I walked around for a little bit more. It was only 6 or 7pm (PST, of course) and because it&#39;s Christmas time, a lot of the stores around Union Square were open later so I walked around there a little bit. It looks even better at night:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/ktQ7u14.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text">I saw some other neat stuff before retiring to my hotel room to write this (now quite extensive) blog post and get some sleep for whatever tomorrow has in store for me.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Entrance to Chinatown (?)" src="http://i.imgur.com/iOJoAz3.jpg" data-caption="Entrance to Chinatown (?)" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/1aIcOL8.jpg" /></p><h4 class="header thin black-text">Bonus Pic!</h4><p class="flow-text">Bonus pic (not mine obviously) of Lombard Street in 1933 (same year Coit Tower was erected) because yay for civic history!</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Before the gardens were planted.
