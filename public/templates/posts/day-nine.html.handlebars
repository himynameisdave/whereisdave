<h2 class="header thin black-text">Day Nine</h2><p class="flow-text">I woke up a little bit sad today over the fact that I have to leave California tonight, and also because I failed my mission of getting behind the Hollywoo Sign, a major to-do for me on this trip. I don&#39;t want to have to go back to the rigidity of my routine, leaving behind of this carefree lifestyle I&#39;ve been living this past week and a bit.</p><p class="flow-text">I somberly packed my things, and then soon found myself at a nearby Starbucks on Wilshire, contemplating what I should do for my last day in Los Angeles. I was in a rather ambivalent mood toward the openness of my day: I had to do SOMETHING in the 9 hours before I had to be at the airport, but I had pretty much already done everything that I intended to. Except one thing.</p><p class="flow-text">Annoyed by the fact that I didn&#39;t conquer Mt. Lee and the Hollywoo Sign yesterday after the coyote sighting, and knowing full well that going back to Toronto not accomplishing this would be the cause of many sleepless nights, I jumped on the 206 Normandie bus in an almost exact deja vu of yesterday. I had to get behind the sign on this trip; anything short would be unacceptable.</p><h4 class="header thin black-text">Everyone in LA is Healthy</h4><p class="flow-text">I stopped in at this little health food deli/convenience store. They sold all sorts of healthganic crap but what caught my eye was the vegan BLT with avocado. I stopped in for my lunch and people watched while I ate, seeing all the fit people come in and order disgusting drinks they pretended to enjoy like Yerba Mate or Kombucha. Everyone (and everything) here is fake, but like it&#39;s kind of okay because it&#39;s a superficial place so everyone just accepts everyone at face value. No one is from LA either. Everyone I&#39;ve talked to is from Utah or Nevada or Insert-Shittier-State-Than-California-Here, and they come here to be the version of themselves they feel they can&#39;t be back home. So like I see people cringe while they gulp down their &quot;Peaceful Warrior&quot; smoothie and even though they hate it on the inside, they&#39;re still happy that they&#39;re in a place where they can drink something ridiculous like that and fit right in without being judged.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Lemons just growing on a tree, right on the side of the road" src="http://i.imgur.com/IfATWJP.jpg" data-caption="Lemons just growing on a tree, right on the side of the road" /></p><p class="flow-text">I left the hippie deli and went up <a href="http://bit.ly/1I17fBf" class="neato-link" target="_blank">Canyon Drive</a>, which is a little bit east of the Loz Feliz entrance that I took to get to the observatory yesterday. This is a very nice street with lots of fancy houses (although not as nice as some I would later see on the way down). At the end of the street there is the beginning of the trail which is part of Griffith park.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="In LA you can post a sign like this an no one bats an eye" src="http://i.imgur.com/vo3CcSc.jpg" data-caption="In LA you can post a sign like this an no one bats an eye" /></p><h4 class="header thin black-text">Hollywoo Sign II</h4><p class="flow-text">It&#39;s beautiful out today. Low 20&#39;s and a cool breeze, and being a Saturday afternoon everyone was out and about, walking their dog or being healthy by running, or just walking and gossiping. Seeing lots of people made me happy though, in case I ran into anymore deadly deadly nature.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="NOW they tell me!" src="http://i.imgur.com/5jRK9Zi.jpg" data-caption="NOW they tell me!" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/oGk23Ao.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="MOUNTAIN LIONS TOO!?! Fucking deadly, deadly nature..." src="http://i.imgur.com/iWMOenZ.jpg" data-caption="MOUNTAIN LIONS TOO!?! Fucking deadly, deadly nature..." /></p><p class="flow-text">I started up the trail. It&#39;s fairly mild like some of the earlier ones yesterday. The horse poop is very much present. Today I don&#39;t have my backback because it is safely back at Katie&#39;s place with my laptop and other carry on items that I didn&#39;t want to bring on the hike. This meant that I had my sweater which had now become to hot to wear, so I decided to tie it around my waste for a little like it was the 90&#39;s again.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/2LkJqfU.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="I&#39;m coming for you!" src="http://i.imgur.com/EDIUoQv.jpg" data-caption="I&#39;m coming for you!" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Farther up the trail" src="http://i.imgur.com/OT56Ef4.jpg" data-caption="Farther up the trail" /></p><p class="flow-text">The trail kept going, higher and higher onto the side of Mt. Lee. I reached a point where I could take an easier roadway or a more scenic trail, and I obviously chose the scenic trail. Again I made a series of wrong turns, although today I was quick to correct them and was more willing to double back given the stakes at hand. These trails are very unforgiving to newcomers.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="I didn&#39;t even bring sunglasses, only a water bottle" src="http://i.imgur.com/0TZyr6i.jpg" data-caption="I didn&#39;t even bring sunglasses, only a water bottle" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/4JptoPp.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="More desolate water containers" src="http://i.imgur.com/8CFkKgk.jpg" data-caption="More desolate water containers" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Those trails tho..." src="http://i.imgur.com/WTcTPVw.jpg" data-caption="Those trails tho..." /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="I&#39;m coming for you bro" src="http://i.imgur.com/VF5ZGlx.jpg" data-caption="I&#39;m coming for you bro" /></p><p class="flow-text">There were points where I didn&#39;t think that the trail I was on would ever connect with Mt. Lee Drive, which is the actual road that leads up behind the Hollywoo sign. There were times where I could even see Mt. Lee Drive below me, but with no access to it aside from a devastating 25ft cliff. Finally, after some other helpful hikers pointed me in the right direction, I saw this:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Sigh of relief" src="http://i.imgur.com/4mVHnEh.jpg" data-caption="Sigh of relief" /></p><p class="flow-text">After this, it was a straight shot to the top. It was extremely windy up here, which I had predicted and was why I brought along my sweater in the first place.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="The other side" src="http://i.imgur.com/8dlSTlc.jpg" data-caption="The other side" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="So close now" src="http://i.imgur.com/oEBKkQA.jpg" data-caption="So close now" /></p><p class="flow-text">The best way I can describe this portion of the walk is that it&#39;s like Canada&#39;s Wonderland but in real life. The anticipation was killing me because I could see the radio tower and knew that right on the other side of the mountain was the sign.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/NzFFr0V.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text">Finally I was right near the top. There was a plaque so I had to be at the top now! I rounded the last of a series of a million corners, and I was at the top!</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="These are the dicks that put up the fences around the sign, some 15 years ago" src="http://i.imgur.com/Pm1IXzs.jpg" data-caption="These are the dicks that put up the fences around the sign, some 15 years ago" /></p><p class="flow-text">Now I had done my research and was fully aware that it is considered trespassing to go up and touch the sign (and who needs to when there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvH1cNMcncc" class="neato-link" target="_blank">dozens of videos</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwW0AdH2csM" class="neato-link" target="_blank">jackasses getting chased</a> off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu3_Imk2yh8" class="neato-link" target="_blank">by LAPD choppers on YouTube</a>), so I knew that this was as close as I would legally be able to get. It was more than enough for me:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="&quot;Ah ah ah, no no no!&quot;" src="http://i.imgur.com/4b6zCia.jpg" data-caption="&quot;Ah ah ah, no no no!&quot;" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/qsFBC4P.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Fuck you Mt.

Lee Drive. I had one last to-do on my list for LA and that was to hit up Los Angeles&#39; only Smoke&#39;s Poutinerie, which is a my favorite (Canadian-owned) poutine spot back home. Actually aside from Berkley this is the only Smoke&#39;s in the whole state of California.</p><p class="flow-text">I had worked up such an appetite after hiking around the hills all day. The way down the hill afforded me some wonderful views of the front of the sign. Some people had a drone that they were flying around it, and they actually seemed to get pretty close to the sign with it without the alarm system going off.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="So amazing" src="http://i.imgur.com/CZ7NBft.jpg" data-caption="So amazing" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Nice houses along Mt.

Lee drive. I got the vibe that these people hate tourists coming up on their otherwise very private little enclave, so I walked as quickly as possible. Also I was starving for poutine. I finally made it to Hollywood, where the Smoke&#39;s was. I got a good shot of Capitol Records too:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/nkYaSkO.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="My face lit up when I saw this" src="http://i.imgur.com/dt62ERK.jpg" data-caption="My face lit up when I saw this" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Thankfully they served Jones Soda, another Canadian staple for me" src="http://i.imgur.com/UnYgHci.jpg" data-caption="Thankfully they served Jones Soda, another Canadian staple for me" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Cool shit" src="http://i.imgur.com/6ovkzPp.jpg" data-caption="Cool shit" /></p><p class="flow-text">The poutine is much better in Canada, but I appreciated the American effort. At least the portions were huge. While at Smoke&#39;s I got Katie a $10 gift card that I put in her Thank You card for being such an awesome host. I figured this was a good, fitting, super-Canadian gift.</p><p class="flow-text">I got myself back to Mariposa by way of bus and grabbed my bags. The people who were AirBnBing in the space after me were actually a student film group who were right in the middle of filming when I walked in. I left Katie&#39;s thank you card, grabbed my bags and jumped in an Uber to LAX. Not to leave LA without the full LA experience, we hit some major traffic on the 110. I wasn&#39;t phased though.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/POMxu60.jpg" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Only in LA!" src="http://i.imgur.com/r28FaQY.jpg" data-caption="Only in LA!" /></p><h4 class="header thin black-text">LAX Chillin&#39;</h4><p class="flow-text">I now find myself at the airport bar waiting for my flight, drinking a (delicious) IPA and catching glances from a cutie from across the bar. The atmosphere is great, they are playing big band/jazz/Sinatra stuff which is suiting me quite well right now. I think I look like a bit of a jackass being on my laptop though so I&#39;m going to finish this up later.</p><p class="flow-text">Funny story: they had to open up my carry on and check for bombs. It was actually painless and they are a lot less nosey than I expected. He knew exactly what he was checking for, which was my laptop charger, and once he saw that it was in no way a bomb, he was put it back and sent me on my way. Despite that, I was still shitting my pants, worried that someone slipped a bomb into my bag and that I would be stuck in a country where people are free to carry lethal weapons and they still mint a coin that is virtually valueless.</p><p class="flow-text">It&#39;s nice to see Blue Jay&#39;s caps and way too overly polite people again in the terminal. It&#39;s going to be odd to go back. I guess I&#39;m looking forward to having my old bed and my old shower back. I&#39;m not excited about the fact that there is basically one week until Christmas though.</p><p class="flow-text">Maybe I&#39;ll write a conclusion tomorrow about my thoughts on the trip as a whole, as well as a bit of a comparison and contrast between the two beautiful cities that I visited. Until next time, I love you, California.</p>
