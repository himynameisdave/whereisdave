<h2 class="header thin black-text">Day One</h2><p class="flow-text">I leave the house just before 3am and my friends are still awake partying from the night before. Given their inebriated state, there was much bro hugging and fist bumping to send me off. My Uber driver Jesse has thankfully been to the airport like a million times and knows exactly where to go. The ride was $26 from my house, a cab undoubtedly would have been over $40.</p><h4 class="header thin black-text">Preflight</h4><p class="flow-text">Arrived at the airport, and the check-in people have all been replaced by robots! I love it! I don&#39;t know why I was stressing because they&#39;ve really streamlined this whole process, it&#39;s really just following the queues. The cold symptoms I was experiencing yesterday have mostly subsided - my throat hurt and my sinuses are still a little clogged. Nothing a little Halls on the plane won&#39;t fix. ;)</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/Uen9OUb.jpg" /></p><h4 class="header thin black-text">Queues for days</h4><p class="flow-text">Okay so apparently there was a delay/the airport people were understaffed because even though I got here 3 hours early I only just cleared customs and baggage, and my flight leaves in 5 mins! Oh yeah I&#39;m writing this from on the plane to Detroit. Air travel is weird. And I forgot how much the customs agent was gonna grill me about my trip... &quot;Are you visiting anyone&quot; lol I even got asked what I do for a living. Anyway glad to be on the plane now. No window seat but I&#39;m pretty sure I have one for the Detroit-&gt;SFO portion of the trip.</p><h4 class="header thin black-text">Planes really book it</h4><p class="flow-text">I didn&#39;t realize it but planes really book it. Like so fast. The entire flight from Toronto to Detroit was 45mins, from like &quot;buckle up&quot; time until landing. I didn&#39;t have a window seat but it was still cool to see the sun coming up over what I initially thought was Lake Ontario but was actually just a giant blanket of clouds.</p><p class="flow-text">I landed at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Metropolitan_Airport#Edward_H._McNamara_Terminal" class="neato-link">McNamara terminal</a> in Detroit and it&#39;s cool they have this little tram thing that can bring you from one end of the terminal to the other (it&#39;s a long ass terminal). There was a Starbucks, complete with a super long line because it&#39;s like 8am. I opted instead to get a cold coffee and pop tart from I guess like a convince store thing. Additional points of interest I saw during this layover were American restaurants like PF Changs and this quintessentially American vending machine for the Michigan State Lottery.

They claim the flight only takes 4hr and 38mins which is less than I expected. &quot;Favourable winds&quot;, says Mr. Pilot :) Nabbed a sweet window seat for this ride though:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="It totally looks like that other plane is smoking..." src="http://i.imgur.com/hpzbpLV.jpg" data-caption="It totally looks like that other plane is smoking..." /></p><p class="flow-text">Kinda looks like that other plane is on fire right? I think they&#39;re just cleaning it... Random.</p><h4 class="header thin black-text">This continent is massive</h4><p class="flow-text">Omg this flight is taking forever. It literally boggles my mind how wide this continent is <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IRL" class="neato-link">IRL</a>. I have no idea how people do those insane 12hr+ flights. You would have to sleep for most of it, something I&#39;ve sadly been unable to really do on the flight except for a few minutes here and there. I am basically running on 3hrs sleep, and I feel it now. My neck hurts from being cranked to look out the window the whole time. Does this look like a frequent flyer to you:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="I don&#39;t know how to smile apparently" src="http://i.imgur.com/um37uwb.jpg" data-caption="I don&#39;t know how to smile apparently" /></p><p class="flow-text">The in-flight progress map thingy has been my other focal point. There is wifi on the plane but you have to pay for the full service, and it&#39;s like $20 so I didn&#39;t bother. Even if you don&#39;t pay for it though, you can still connect to it and Google search queries are still returned, so searching something like &quot;what is the state north of Colorado?&quot; or &quot;San Francisco current weather&quot; will return a Google &#39;card&#39; with all that info on it. That&#39;s all the internet I need! (By the way if you guessed Wyoming as the state north of Colorado, you were right!)</p><p class="flow-text">Here&#39;s some pretty things I saw from the plane:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="This is going into Iowa, the whole state is covered in snow. Newbraska too!" src="http://i.imgur.com/MsVeTdq.jpg" data-caption="This is going into Iowa, the whole state is covered in snow. Newbraska too!" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="The in-flight, on-screen thingy, about halfway through the flight" src="http://i.imgur.com/U7wG1b0.jpg" data-caption="The in-flight, on-screen thingy, about halfway through the flight" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Nevada was the prettiest state we flew over. Also not a lot of clouds." src="http://i.imgur.com/LYovhc4.jpg" data-caption="Nevada was the prettiest state we flew over. Also not a lot of clouds." /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Mountains around the California/Nevada border" src="http://i.imgur.com/yaZfysD.jpg" data-caption="Mountains around the California/Nevada border" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Technically, this was the first second I was in California" src="http://i.imgur.com/zzIsWHD.jpg" data-caption="Technically, this was the first second I was in California" /></p><p class="flow-text">I was shocked to see a lot of states covered in snow, such as Iowa, because we are yet to have a true snowfall in southern Ontario yet. Nevada was probably the prettiest state to fly over, with its mix of arid deserts and giant mountains.</p><h4 class="header thin black-text">Arriving at SFO</h4><p class="flow-text">So as soon as I landed at SFO my phone connected to the network and I got a mass of messages from people back home wondering if I had made it here okay. I did. My bag made it too. No hassle with the whole &quot;Dave vs David&quot; thing on my ticket either. My ears are hurting from the popping/sinuses acting up so I hope that get sorted out pronto. So yeah just picked up my bags and now I&#39;m sitting in the airport, pushing this up so that you guys can see how its going. Next task is to jump on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit" class="neato-link">BART</a> and head into the city.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="I thought this was cool" src="http://i.imgur.com/tyPFNCD.jpg" data-caption="I thought this was cool" /></p><p class="flow-text">Check back later, the day is still young!</p>
