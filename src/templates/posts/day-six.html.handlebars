<h2 class="header thin black-text">Day Six</h2><p class="flow-text">I woke up feeling well rested this morning, and with a beautiful breeze coming through the open windows. Katie has a little coffee machine that&#39;s all ready to go so all I had to do was turn it on :) I drank some coffee and had one of her delicious banana pecan muffins while I wrote day five&#39;s post and planned out my day. Today, Dave does <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pY4XNYn.jpg" class="neato-link">Hollywoo</a>!</p><h4 class="header thin black-text">Hollywood</h4><p class="flow-text">I know I&#39;ve said this before but I&#39;ll say it again, LA IS HUGE. I left the house around 9:30 in the morning, and was still feeling a little peckish so I stopped in at a nearby McDonalds for some hash browns (because I haven&#39;t had their hash browns in like forever). I then proceeded to walk <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vhHnEwDhBiq" class="neato-link">all the way to Hollywood Blvd.</a>, which is by no means close because it&#39;s LA and nothing is close.</p><p class="flow-text">The weather is very very nice here, sunshine and it was warm enough to be in a t-shirt. I could have even got away with shorts. I started up a hill and caught my first (very distant) glimpse of the Hollywoo sign. Can you see it?</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="So far away" src="http://i.imgur.com/q7HVl0x.jpg" data-caption="So far away" /></p><p class="flow-text">I eventually made it down to the Hollywoo walk of fame, which is very expansive because they put everyone who has ever been in a film or TV show in the past 1000 years on it. I literally saw a star for Tinkerbell.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Tom Hanks&#39; star" src="http://i.imgur.com/te4qVOw.jpg" data-caption="Tom Hanks&#39; star" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Maybe if I remake Snow Dogs I&#39;ll get a star too..." src="http://i.imgur.com/ypQ8lq0.jpg" data-caption="Maybe if I remake Snow Dogs I&#39;ll get a star too..." /></p><p class="flow-text">Here&#39;s the Capitol Records building (much smaller than I imagined):</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Capitol Records building" src="http://i.imgur.com/Vn8cWw9.jpg" data-caption="Capitol Records building" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Looking down Hollywood Blvd." src="http://i.imgur.com/iIS0Sbe.jpg" data-caption="Looking down Hollywood Blvd." /></p><p class="flow-text">At this point after all the walking I was hungry, so I stopped into this place called Melt on Sunset which does like really quality grilled cheese sammies:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="It was delicious" src="http://i.imgur.com/T5hZidO.jpg" data-caption="It was delicious" /></p><p class="flow-text">By this point it was easier to see the Hollywoo sign:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="There was a blimp advertising the Peanut movie" src="http://i.imgur.com/1Mb7V5z.jpg" data-caption="There was a blimp advertising the Peanut movie" /></p><p class="flow-text">I walked further down Hollywood Blvd. and saw Kimmel&#39;s studios.</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Very cool..." src="http://i.imgur.com/vhgndHt.jpg" data-caption="Very cool..." /></p><p class="flow-text">It was not far from here that I noticed a camera crew speeding down the street interviewing people. As luck would have it they asked me to finish the following sentence: &quot;Donald Trump is the worst thing to happen to...&quot; and the response they were looking for was &quot;ISIS&quot; (which is a statement Trump had made earlier in the week). The joke was that everyone had something else to finish the sentence with, and my response was &quot;America&quot;. I signed a release and they actually used my bit! You can see me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zmlQbt2UIA" class="neato-link">in this video</a> for half a second shortly after the 1:04 mark. Only in LA!</p><p class="flow-text">After this I meandered around for a little bit more. I saw some cool stuff:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Probably used for shooting something set in Chicago?" src="http://i.imgur.com/30M5ZWk.jpg" data-caption="Probably used for shooting something set in Chicago?" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Dolby Theatre" src="http://i.imgur.com/EUDr5yD.jpg" data-caption="Dolby Theatre" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="TCL Chinese Theatre" src="http://i.imgur.com/IVEBDEU.jpg" data-caption="TCL Chinese Theatre" /></p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="Madame Tussauds" src="http://i.imgur.com/yGwz6KS.jpg" data-caption="Madame Tussauds" /></p><p class="flow-text">It was starting to get later in the afternoon and I was tired from all the walking so I wanted to head back and take a nap before dinnertime. I walked about halfway back and then Uber&#39;d the rest of the way. Look at how beautiful it is from my window:</p><p class="flow-text"><img class="responsive-img materialboxed" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/06xjxMM.jpg" /></p><h4 class="header thin black-text">Jurassic Pizza</h4><p class="flow-text">I took a short power nap, and then set out to feed myself dinner. Google found me a really cool pizza pub on Wilshire not far from where I was staying. I headed there and it was so cool! They had an awesome selection of craft beers and they were playing the original Jurassic Park movie. I sat and watched the entire thing while I ate a delicious handmade pizza, which was fun because me and the other patrons provided some fun commentary for the movie and laughed at the goofy parts <a href="https://youtu.be/JlOx9738iyw?t=15s" class="neato-link">(like Goldblum&#39;s laugh)</a>. After this I walked around the neighbourhood for a little, found a Baskin Robbins and got myself some ice cream before retiring to the house for the night. I Netflixed for a little but fell asleep very soon after - I was so tired.</p>
